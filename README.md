# CIIC4030_PL_Project

## IDEA
 Almost every developer who has worked on a front-end project has had to work through making every small portion of the GUI wishes it couldâ€™ve been developed faster and in a less tedious manner. This programming language is intended for helping the front-end developer generate their designs and drafts of what their front-end should look like. With simple to use syntax, and quick generation of shapes and the manipulation of these, U-GUI is sure to help any developer create their designs and drafts in a quick simple manner.

U-GUI utilizes the lexer.py module and U-GUI Parser.py. U-GUI Parser.py is the module where the application runs and initializes the terminal. Input is parsed by yacc using the PLY library. U-GUI makes heavy use of the Tkinter Python library and relies on this to generate the shapes and other objects.
